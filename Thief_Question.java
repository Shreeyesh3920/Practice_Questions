/*There are N houses built in a line, each of which contains some value in it. 
 * A thief is going to steal the maximum value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal 
 * in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two 
 * neighbors left and right sides. The task is to find what is the maximum stolen value.

Examples: 
Input: hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
Output: 19
Explanation: The thief will steal 6, 1, 8 and 4 from the house.

Input: hval[] = {5, 3, 4, 11, 2}
Output: 16
